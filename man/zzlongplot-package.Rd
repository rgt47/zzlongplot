\title{Flexible Plotting of Observed and Change Values with Grouping and Faceting}
\description{
These functions provide a flexible framework for generating observed
and change plots using a data frame, accommodating both continuous and
categorical variables for the x-axis. They handle baseline (\code{baseline_value})
specification, grouping, and faceting. This version allows the user to return
either the observed plot, the change plot, or both combined side-by-side using
the \strong{patchwork} package.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \code{compute_stats}: Computes summary statistics for observed and change values,
adapting to continuous or categorical x-axis variables.
\item \code{generate_plot}: Dynamically generates ggplot objects based on whether the
x-axis is continuous or categorical, supports error representation (bars or
ribbons), and faceting.
\item \code{parse_formula}: Parses the formula to extract dependent, independent,
grouping, and faceting variables.
\item \code{lplot}: Combines the functionality of the helper functions to produce
the final plots or combined plots as specified.
