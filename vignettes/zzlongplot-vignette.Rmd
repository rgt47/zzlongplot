# Introduction

`zzlongplot` is an R package designed for creating flexible and customizable visualizations of longitudinal data. Whether you are working with clinical trial data, repeated measures, or any data with a time- or visit-dependent structure, `zzlongplot` simplifies the process of creating grouped, faceted, and error-represented plots.

This vignette provides an overview of the package and demonstrates its key functionality through examples.

---

# Installation

To install the `zzlongplot` package from GitHub, use the following commands:

```r
install.packages("devtools") # If not already installed
devtools::install_github("your-username/zzlongplot")
```

Make sure to load the package before use:

```r
library(zzlongplot)
```

---

# Example Data

We will use synthetic datasets to demonstrate the functionality of `zzlongplot`.

### Continuous x-axis

```r
# Generate example data
df_cont <- data.frame(
  rid = rep(1:10, each = 3),
  visit = rep(c(0, 1, 2), times = 10),
  measure = rnorm(30, mean = 50, sd = 10),
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), length.out = 30)
)
```

### Categorical x-axis

```r
# Generate example data
df_cat <- data.frame(
  rid = rep(1:10, each = 3),
  visit = rep(c("baseline", "month1", "month2"), times = 10),
  measure = rnorm(30, mean = 50, sd = 10),
  group = rep(c("A", "B"), length.out = 30)
)
```

# Using `lplot`

The primary function in `zzlongplot` is `lplot`, which generates the desired plots. This function combines observed values and change values into a single framework.

### Observed Plot with Continuous x-axis

```r
# Create observed plot
plot_obs <- lplot(
  df_cont,
  form = measure ~ visit | group,
  zeroval = 0,
  xlab = "Visit",
  ylab = "Measure",
  title = "Observed Values Over Time"
)
print(plot_obs)
```

### Observed Plot with Categorical x-axis

```r
# Create observed plot with categorical x-axis
plot_cat <- lplot(
  df_cat,
  form = measure ~ visit | group,
  zeroval = "baseline",
  xlab = "Visit",
  ylab = "Measure",
  title = "Observed Values Over Time (Categorical)"
)
print(plot_cat)
```

### Combined Observed and Change Plots

To display both observed and change plots side-by-side:

```r
# Combine observed and change plots
plot_both <- lplot(
  df_cont,
  form = measure ~ visit | group,
  zeroval = 0,
  ytype = "both",
  title = "Observed and Change Values"
)
print(plot_both)
```

# Customizing Plots

### Error Representation

Choose how to represent uncertainty using the `etype` argument:
- `"bar"`: Error bars
- `"band"`: Error ribbons

```r
# Observed plot with error bars
plot_error_bar <- lplot(
  df_cont,
  form = measure ~ visit | group,
  zeroval = 0,
  etype = "bar",
  title = "Observed Values with Error Bars"
)
print(plot_error_bar)

# Observed plot with error ribbons
plot_error_band <- lplot(
  df_cont,
  form = measure ~ visit | group,
  zeroval = 0,
  etype = "band",
  title = "Observed Values with Error Bands"
)
print(plot_error_band)
```

### Faceting

Faceting allows stratified visualizations. Use the `facet_form` argument to specify row and column facets.

```r
# Add a new variable for faceting
df_cont$site <- rep(c("Site 1", "Site 2"), length.out = nrow(df_cont))

# Create faceted plot
plot_facet <- lplot(
  df_cont,
  form = measure ~ visit | group,
  facet_form = ~ site,
  zeroval = 0,
  title = "Faceted Observed Values"
)
print(plot_facet)
```

# Helper Functions

`zzlongplot` includes several helper functions that work behind the scenes but can also be used independently.

### `compute_stats`

This function computes summary statistics for observed and change values.

```r
# Compute statistics
stats <- compute_stats(df_cont, "visit", "measure", "group", "rid", 0)
print(stats)
```

### `generate_plot`

This function creates a ggplot object based on the computed statistics.

```r
# Generate a plot
plot <- generate_plot(
  stats,
  x = "visit",
  y = "mn",
  grp = "grp",
  etype = "band",
  xlab = "Visit",
  ylab = "Measure",
  title = "Generated Plot"
)
print(plot)
```

# Summary

`zzlongplot` simplifies the visualization of longitudinal data, providing robust tools for observed and change plots, error representations, grouping, and faceting. Its intuitive formula-based interface ensures ease of use, while customization options cater to advanced use cases.
